# jv-tree-traversal

Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. Following are the generally used ways for traversing trees.


![tree example](./tree12.gif)


Depth First Traversals:
- Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3
- Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3
- Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1

Breadth First Traversal : 1 2 3 4 5

Task: Please implement all Tree Traversal cases. Add your implementation in BinaryTree class
